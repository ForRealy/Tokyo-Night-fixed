This version currently works on the PTB version of discord, for the most part, and should mirror most of the previous versions of the theme. There are probably sections which are different, and some which are unimplemented at the moment. I'll fix it probably eventually.
The light mode has been taken out as well as BD stuff, and I've only edited `tokyo-night.theme.css` to work.
